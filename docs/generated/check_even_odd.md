# Even or Odd Checker
======================

This is a simple program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

### Usage

To use this program, simply run it and follow the prompt to enter a number. The program will then print out whether the number is even or odd.

### Code Walkthrough
-------------------

### Main Program
```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("The number is odd.")
```

#### Description

This program consists of a single code block that performs the following tasks:

* Asks the user to enter a number using the `input` function.
* Converts the input to an integer using the `int` function.
* Checks whether the number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0, then the number is even.
* Prints out a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.

#### Notes

* This program does not handle errors or invalid inputs. For example, if the user enters a non-numeric value, the program will raise a `ValueError`.
* This program does not provide any return value or output that can be used by other programs. It simply prints out a message to the console.

There are no functions or classes in this code, so there is no additional documentation to provide.
