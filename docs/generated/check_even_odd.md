**Checking Even or Odd**
=====================

This program checks whether a given number is even or odd.

### `Main Program`
#### Purpose
The main program prompts the user to enter a number, then determines whether the number is even or odd, and prints the result.

#### How it Works
The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.

#### Parameters
None

#### Return Value
None

#### Side Effects
* Prints a message to the console indicating whether the number is even or odd.

**Note**: This program does not have any reusable functions or classes, so there is no need to document individual components. The entire program is a simple, self-contained script.

I hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further requests.
